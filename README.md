### Page 1: The Basics

#### Understand the Format 
Case interviews are hypothetical business scenarios where you're expected to identify problems and propose solutions. They test analytical skills, business acumen, and communication abilities.

Familiarize Yourself with Common Types of Cases
These include: 
1. **Market Sizing:** Also known as guesstimate cases, they involve estimating the size of a particular market or segment in terms of revenue, units, or population. These cases test your logical reasoning, quantitative skills, and ability to make reasonable assumptions.
2. **Business Strategy:** These cases often involve strategic decisions such as entering a new market, launching a product, or responding to a competitor's move. They test your ability to analyze an industry, evaluate options, and devise a strategic plan.
3. **Mergers & Acquisitions:** These cases involve evaluating a potential acquisition or merger opportunity. You might be asked to assess the strategic fit, conduct a valuation, or plan the integration process.
4. **Operations:** These cases often deal with issues related to supply chain, process improvement, cost reduction, or quality control. They test your ability to identify operational inefficiencies and devise practical solutions.
5. **Pricing:** These cases involve setting or adjusting the price for a product or service. You might need to consider factors like costs, competition, customer willingness to pay, and overall company strategy.

Practice, Practice, Practice: Use resources like Case In Point, Victor Cheng's materials, or online platforms like PrepLounge.

### Page 2: The Approach

Understand the Problem: Clarify the problem statement and the objectives of the case. Ask insightful questions if needed.

Structure Your Thoughts: Use a framework (like Porter's Five Forces, the 4 P's of Marketing, SWOT, etc.) to systematically approach the problem. This demonstrates your ability to think logically and methodically.

Hypothesize: Formulate hypotheses early and test them throughout the case. This shows you can think strategically and make educated guesses.

### Page 3: The Execution

Analyze Qualitatively and Quantitatively: Use both qualitative and quantitative analysis to support your arguments.

Be Comfortable with Mental Math: Fast, accurate mental math is crucial. Brush up on quick multiplication, division, percentages, and estimation techniques.

Synthesize Information: Summarize your findings and how they relate to your initial hypotheses.

### Page 4: The Delivery

Communicate Clearly: Clearly explain your thought process, analyses, and recommendations. Good consultants can break down complex ideas into understandable pieces.

Be Structured in Your Response: Use a top-down communication style. Start with the answer (your recommendation) and then provide the supporting arguments.

Engage in a Conversation: Case interviews are meant to be interactive. Engage with the interviewer, ask questions, and bounce ideas off them.

### Page 5: The Mindset

Stay Calm and Collected: Your ability to remain composed under pressure is being evaluated. If you're stuck, don't panic. Instead, ask clarifying questions or take a moment to gather your thoughts.

Showcase Your Problem-Solving Skills: Demonstrate how you can break down complex problems and arrive at a solution using a structured approach.

Be Coachable: Show that you can take feedback and adapt your approach. This is a sign that you'll be able to learn and grow on the job.

Remember, the goal is not necessarily to "solve" the case, but to demonstrate your problem-solving skills, business acumen, and communication abilities.
